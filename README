 Description:
 The purpose of this programming assignment is to gain more experience with:

 ARM assembly bit-wise operations
 Memory loads and stores (ldr/str)
 Mapping local variables on the runtime stack and accessing them relative to 
 frame pointer (fp)
 Using Standard C Library routines and varied techniques to communicate C
 Preprocessor-derived values to your assembly routines (accessing global
 variables set in a C function and calling C functions from assembly)
 For this assignment you are writing an interactive program that takes user
 input from the command line and prints the BCD clocks accordingly to stdout.
 This program will require appropriate error checking and reporting.


 How to build/compile the program:
 1) You first login to the ucsd ieng6 account
 2) Then we need to ssh cs30xxy@pi-cluster.ucsd.edu
 3) Then we need to creat a directory named pa1
 4) Then we write c and assembly and c files
 5) Then we build the assembly and c files by following the pa
    instructions
 6) Afterward, we compile the program by "make"
 7) Usually, we might need to "make clean" 
 8) Then we would have a executionable file named pa1
 9) we run the program by saying ./pa2

Example of normal output:
  Sun Nov  4 18:13:03 2018

  PPPPPPPPPPPP
  | .. .. .. |
  | .o .. .. |
  | .o .o .o |
  | .. oo .o |
  | 06 13 03 |
  PPPPPPPPPPPP

Example of abnormal output:

Number of clock ticks 1231213 not within range [0-61]

Usage: /home/linux/ieng6/cs30f/cs30fex/../public/pa2test [numTicks [startTime]]
| [--help]
    numTicks  -- (optional) number of clock ticks to display
                     Must be within the range of [0-61]
                     Default number of ticks is 7
    startTime -- (optional) starting time of the clock entered as 
    HH:MM:SS(A|a|P|p)
                     HH must be within the range of [0-12]
                     MM must be within the range of [0-59]
                     SS must be within the range of [0-59]
                     (A|a|P|p) one option must be specified
                     Default start time is the current time
                                                             
How you tested your program:
I used gdb to help me debug the errors. By step, next, nexti commands, I am
able to find the compilation and logical erros at specific lines of function. 
In this pa, there are a lot of segmentation errors. I used gdp to find the
memory leaks and was able to make sure the program run without bugs. Then
finally, I used the diff command to find the difference between the
original and the standard solution.

README questions

1)What would you do to ensure integrity if you find out a major logical issue
with the code while the deadline is in several hours?

To ensure integrity, I will just submit everything because I know I will be
tempted to violate acadeic integrity. I would take a 20% deduction if I feel
I can possible fix it at the later deadline.

2)Assume in some C code you have the following array:
int arr[] = {0, 1, 2};
What is the other way to store the value of the third element of arr to an 
int x
other than int x = arr[2]. (Hint: think about pointer manipulationï)

int* ptr = arr;
*(ptr+2) = x;

3) In vim, what are the commands to show and hide line numbers?

In command line mode: we type ":set nonumber" to show line numbers

In command line mode: we type: ":set nonumber: to hide line numbers

4) In vim, what would be the command to quickly move the cursor to

a. The end of the line and start edit mode) 

o

b. The start of the line while staying in command mode

0

c. One word forward

w

d. 5 lines above

5k

5) what is the unix command to quit from current file without saving the edits 
you made?

:q!

6)Without opening your main.c file, how could you print the line containing 
argc  with line number and a context of 3 lines around the current
line? (3 line before and after the line containing argc)

grep agrc main.c

7)What is the command to check how many files are there in your directory? 
This command should only prints one number indicating the number of files 
and should be done in a single line.


ls -1 | wc -l
